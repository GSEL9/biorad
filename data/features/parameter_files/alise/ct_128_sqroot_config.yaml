setting:
  # Distance to neighbour: Specifies the distances between the center voxel and
  # the neighbor, for which angles should be generated. Only affects the GLCM
  # and NGTDM feature classes. The GLSZM and GLRLM feature classes use a fixed
  # distance of 1 (infinity norm) to define neighbours.
  distances: [1]
  # Gray level discretization: 128 bins.
