# Configuration setup file for PyRadiomics first order feature extraction.
#
# PyRadiomics version: 2.0.1
#

setting:
  # Avoid Z-scoring to maintain image dynamics.
  normalize: True
  # Value of ROI in mask is binary where zero represents the background.
  label: 1
  # Distance to neighbour: Specifies the distances between the center voxel and
  # the neighbor, for which angles should be generated. Only affects the GLCM
  # and NGTDM feature classes. The GLSZM and GLRLM feature classes use a fixed
  # distance of 1 (infinity norm) to define neighbours.
  distances: [1]
  # Gray level discretization: 128 bins calculated from image without Z-scoring.
  binWidth: 0.589102564102564
  # Disable output of additional information from the extraction.
  additionalInfo: False
  # Shifting gray level values > 0 due to normalization as required by some
  # texture features. Shift value is ceiling of average of global max across
  # all CT samples, which is the largest value used in zero-centering for
  # nomralization.
  # NOTE: Requires <int>.
